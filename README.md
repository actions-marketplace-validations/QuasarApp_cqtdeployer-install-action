# CQtDeployer Install Action

A GitHub Action to automatically download, extract, and install **CQtDeployer** for Linux (x64 / ARM64) and Windows (x64) runners.

This action eliminates boilerplate code in your workflows, allowing you to install CQtDeployer with a single line of code across different operating systems and CPU architectures.


## Usage

Add the following step to your GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/build.yml`):

```yaml
- name: Install CQtDeployer
  uses: QuasarApp/cqtdeployer-install-action@v1.0.0
  
```


## Full Workflow Example
Here is a complete example of how to use this action in a matrix build for both Linux and Windows:

```yaml

name: CI Build and Deploy

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Source Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 1. Install CQtDeployer using this custom action
      - name: Setup CQtDeployer
        uses: твоё-имя-аккаунта/cqtdeployer-install-action@v1.0.0

      # 3. Run deployment for your Qt Application (Linux)
      - name: Deploy Application (Linux)
        if: runner.os == 'Linux'
        shell: bash
        run: |
          cqtdeployer -bin my_qt_app -qmake /path/to/qt/bin/qmake

      # 4. Run deployment for your Qt Application (Windows)
      - name: Deploy Application (Windows)
        if: runner.os == 'Windows'
        shell: pwsh
        run: |
          cqtdeployer -bin my_qt_app.exe -qmake C:\path\to\qt\bin\qmake.exe
```
